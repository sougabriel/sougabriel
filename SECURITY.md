# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate the efforts of security researchers to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities they find in our project.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible by opening a issue in this project. We will work with you to assess and address the vulnerability promptly.

## Bug Bounty Program

To encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities, we offer a bug bounty program. We will reward individuals who report valid security vulnerabilities according to the following criteria:

- **Severity**: The severity of the vulnerability, as determined by our team.
- **Impact**: The potential impact of the vulnerability on our users and systems.
- **Quality**: The quality of the vulnerability report, including clear steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant details.
- **Scope**: The vulnerability must be within the scope of our bug bounty program.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

When reporting security vulnerabilities, please follow these guidelines:

- Provide detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any necessary prerequisites.
- Include information about the environment in which the vulnerability was discovered (e.g., operating system, browser version).
- Avoid disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to assess and address it.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability for any purpose other than demonstrating the security issue to us.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and transparently. Upon receiving a security report, we will:

- Acknowledge receipt of the report and provide an initial assessment within 72 hours.
- Work with the reporter to validate and reproduce the vulnerability.
- Develop and implement a fix for the vulnerability.
- Communicate openly and transparently with the reporter throughout the process.

## Legal

We reserve the right to update these security policies at any time. Participation in our bug bounty program constitutes acceptance of these policies. We will not take legal action against security researchers who report vulnerabilities to us in accordance with these guidelines.
